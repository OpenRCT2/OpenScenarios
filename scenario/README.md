#Refactor by 733737

Changed Scenarios description to better match syntax of original game and remove created by maian_sos...
I kept all original files in legacy folder...
The folder "scenarios" was changed to "scenario" to match openrct2 file structure.
Issue with rides transferring in Scenario editor means I could only convert select scenarios.
The scenarios did not have any changes made other than description and converting to new format (except park with 1 ride could not be kept in the same category)
Known Issues:
The author of these scenarios should be consulted before this PR is merged.
Wild Water World Cannot be put in Challenging Category
Rides cannot be transferred without either completely recreating them or time consuming adjustments to terrain so I have not added all of the custom scenarios
in the initial release.
I have the scenarios paused but that could easily be changed.
I may have slightly moved the starting camera on the scenarios or zoomed out...
