In this directory, Create a Subdirectory the same name as your final sc6 from `../Scenarios`, and inside of the folder put the Unfinished Scenario 
Save (See Root README.md for requirements) as well as the screenshot.

The reason I am requiring these files is simply so that in the future, when OpenRCT2 switches to it's own format, we can re-export all the scenarios 
as scenarios in the new format.
