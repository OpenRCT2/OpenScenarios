Title: Gentleman's Garden

Description: Build a park for those who prefer a less intense experience in this beautiful garden.

Objective: 800 Guests by End of Year 2

Difficulty: Easy

Notes: This park has guest-preference set to low-intensity, and the available rides reflect this. While money is set to a 15k loan maximum and space is limited, this scenario should not be hard to beat, du to a relativly easy objective.
