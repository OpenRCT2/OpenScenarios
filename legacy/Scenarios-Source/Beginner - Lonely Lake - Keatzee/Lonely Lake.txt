Title: Lonely Lake

Description: This secluded lake was once a popular fushing spot decades ago. Now abandoned, turn it into a popular amusement park.

Objective: To have at least 250 guests in your park at the end of October, Year 1, with a park rating of at least 600

Difficulty: Beginner

Since pretty much every release and expansion of RCT1/2 had a scenario with "Lake" in the title, OpenScenarios should too. This is very easy, with a "Forest Frontiers" feel; I designed this with an absolute beginner in mind.
