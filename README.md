[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/PFCKrutonium/OpenRCT2-OpenScenarios](https://badges.gitter.im/PFCKrutonium/OpenRCT2-OpenScenarios.svg)](https://gitter.im/PFCKrutonium/OpenRCT2-OpenScenarios?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)  
Replacement Scenarios and Campaign for the Scenarios that came with RCT2 Originally. The goal is to create a campaign of +/- 30 scenarios with a good difficulty curve like in RCT1.

Contribution and Approval process is not yet complete, but feel free to open PR's with Scenarios.

### REQUIREMENTS TO SUBMIT A SCENARIO:

1. Must include the Finished Scenario  
2. Must include a Save of the Scenario at the last step of Scenario Creation  
2. Must inlude a text file containing the Goal of the Scenario - IE X guests by Y date.
3. Should include a Screenshot
4. Should include a Description of the Scenario, and mention what difficulty category it is
5. Should have at least 1 person that is not the scenario creator play test it and verify that the scenario has no major issues, and that the difficulty is set correctly.

### SCENARIO DESIGN GUIDELINES:

- The scenario must be able to be completed in a convenient way. This means without using cheats or massively exploiting game mechanics (like microcoasters).
- Using cheats to create the scenario is acceptable as long as the park is reproducible without cheats, thus no usage of zero clearance or tile inspector for example.
- Also no rides outside park boundaries, trackitecture or hacked rides.
- Only use objects (rides, scenery, paths, terrain ...) labeled with _RCT2_ or _OpenRCT2 Official_, so no RCT1-exclusive or custom objects, or from the expansions (WW/TT).

### HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:

If you know how, make a PR with the files in the correct locations. If not, then please make an issue, with all the requested files in a Zip file, and upload them as part of the issue. In both scenarios, there will be additional verification of the park to ensure that it works well.

Thanks for taking the time to Contribute!

Please Note: There are exceptions for Parks that existed _before_ this project existed, and the original source files have been lost. In all such cases, the original owner has given permission for them to be used. IF YOUR PARK HAS BEEN USED WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION, PLEASE CONTACT ME, THIS WAS NOT ON PURPOSE.
