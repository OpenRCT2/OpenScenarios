Title: Flyover Fun Center

Description: "This small entertainment center is not permitted to build anything tall due to the nearby airport - develop it into a successful family-friendly attraction"

Objective: 1000 guests after end of Year 3

Difficulty: Challenging

Design Notes: The scenario is intended to serve as an introduction to scenario restrictions, featuring a build height restriction. Coaster selection is likewise limited.

This scenario has been modified from its original version to fit an early-Challenging campaign placement.
