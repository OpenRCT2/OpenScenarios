Title: Shimmering Shores

Description: "Build a compact park on a thin pier in this beachside town"

Objective: 700 Guests at end of Year 2

Difficulty: Beginner

Design Notes: The initial pier is 360 tiles, approximately the same as Dinky Park's starting land. The second pier and the construction rights between can be bought. 

The pier land texture is set to concrete in place of the original texture, the RCT1 wood texture. If a wood texture is added to Open, this scenario could be modified to use it. The scenario also makes use of the new colors for some scenery elements, thus v0.4.5+ is needed.

This scenario's difficulty has been modified from its original version, to fit a late-Beginner campaign placement.
