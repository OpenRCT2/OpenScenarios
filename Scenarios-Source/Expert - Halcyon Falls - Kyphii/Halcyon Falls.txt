Title: Halcyon Falls

Description: "This historic park has fallen on hard times - pay off its massive debt while preserving its vintage rides"

Objective: Pay off debt and achieve $250,000 park value

Difficulty: Expert

Design Notes: The scenario starts with a debt of $125,000 at 2% interest. Paying off this debt is the primary goal of the scenario - by the time it is paid off, the player should have also achieved the park value goal.

The prebuilt rides are all under preservation orders, and are intended to be challenging to work around. Several have low throughput, making them a persistent challenge throughout the scenario. Refurbishing the rides is an option, but is not expected to complete the scenario.
